This application is built completely with Java with the UI View Built with JavaFx 8, the current mainstream standardisation for User interface design in Java. 

## What is a Numeronym?
A numeronym is a **number-based word**, typically not more than 4 letters in length. Most commonly, a numeronym is a word where a number is used to form an abbreviation (albeit not an acronym or an initialism).Sometimes, pronounciations are considered (k9 for canine) which is beyond the scope of this program.

The first numeronym of this kind was **"S12n"**, the electronic mail account name given to *Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)* employee *Jan Scherpenhuizen* by a system administrator... 

..because **his surname was too long to be an account name**!

## Options:
This program provides two options : 
### Preserve Case
This option maintains that original casing of strings. If unchecked, converts the string to lowercase.
### Use Strict
This option maintains that the length constraint of exactly 4 characters in a numeronym.

## Building the Application

Executables for different operating systems can be generated by editing the `fxbuild.build` file, following which we generate an `AntBuild` to generate the installers of the OS specific applications.

For the detailed, step-by-step process for app deployment, one can refer [this link](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/part7/).
